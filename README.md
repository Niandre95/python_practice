# Working with Python
### Using Python to read, create and interact with different file types
## Files scripts working with files
Below files allow a user to create, read, and append contents to files. The files can be run as scripts in the terminal of your choice or you can open and run them in any Python-supported IDE of your choice
#### creating_csv.py

#### data.csv
data.csv file is the output file from running the creating_csv.py file.
#### reading_csv.py

#### info.txt
info.txt contains personal information like first name, last name, and country.
#### append_csv.py

## Working with Pyhton OOP(Object Oriented Programming)
#### person_class.py

#### person_class02.py
Person_class02.py file display more information about the objects created in the class. This file uses methods to display the object which makes the code reusable.

## Installation
